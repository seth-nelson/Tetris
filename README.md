# Tetris
A simple Tetris game made with JavaScript

<!-- ## This is a basic game of Tetris made entirely from JS and HTML. It utilizes a grid system made from divs to shift and move the pieces around. It also has a fully functional scoreboard with saved data. Mobile version is also available. -->

Utilizes sets of array index for shape and box creation and movement. The initial loop creates the large and small grid directly on the dom with preset properties.

Borders work off of mathmetical operators by preventing the index of the specified div from moving to an index that matches numbers past the border.

The shape movement is done by moving the index forward or backward depending on the key code that is pressed.

A scoreboard is also mplemented, as well as a pause button and a reset button.

--Unfinished, still a work in progress--
